AI:

In the simplest terms, AI which stands for artificial intelligence refers to systems or machines that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the information they collect. AI manifests in a number of forms. A few examples are:

Chatbots use AI to understand customer problems faster and provide more efficient answers
Intelligent assistants use AI to parse critical information from large free-text datasets to improve scheduling
Recommendation engines can provide automated recommendations for TV shows based on users’ viewing habits
AI is much more about the process and the capability for superpowered thinking and data analysis than it is about any particular format or function. Although AI brings up images of high-functioning, human-like robots taking over the world, AI isn’t intended to replace humans. It’s intended to significantly enhance human capabilities and contributions. That makes it a very valuable business asset.
